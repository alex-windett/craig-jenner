		<h3>Brief</h3>
		<p>I was asked to completely redesign the Duo website as part of a wider rebrand that positioned the brand more into higher-end fashion, providing full wireframes and responsive designs to, frankly, crazy deadlines. The new brand was to be called Ted&Muffy after the founders.</p>
		<p>The main USP of the brand is that all their boots require a calf measurement. This makes them fit much better but complicated the shopping process on the website. Striking a balance between promoting this aspect of the brand and not making the site feel like a specialist brand was a delicate process.</p>
		<p>There were a couple of restrictions, particularly that they weren’t changing their back-end system which turned out to be extremely restrictive and unfortunately compromised the UX in a couple of places.</p>

		<p>The biggest challenge with Ted&Muffy was working out how different users use navs and filters. Some users will know exactly what they want and expect to be able to jump straight to the most relevant category. Others would prefer to browse through a wide range of products. This was confirmed by the user testing.</p>
		<p>We thought a mega-nav was probably the best option, knowing a lot of people will just click ‘view all boots’ and start narrowing down from the PLP, but users who know they want a high heel, or red ankle boots, or something suede could easily just jump straight to where they need to be.</p>
		<p>We also decided to put the sizing information right at the top of the filters section, mainly to just flag this aspect of the business early on. I wanted to avoid users getting through to the PDP and then realising they were going to have to track down a tape measure. Having to measure your calf should feel like a good thing (which it genuinely is) rather than a chore. This also informed the design for the PDP itself.</p>
