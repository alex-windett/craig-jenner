		<h3>Brief</h3>
		<p>After an extensive rebrand, Dorset Cereals wanted to overhaul their extremely popular Spin to Win instant win game where users could spin a milk bottle to determine what prize they’d win. It obviously had to fit the new pack design which featured woodland characters on various bits of foliage, it had to tie in with the ‘Life Begins at Breakfast’ tagline, the result of the game had to be completely down to chance, and it had to meet a few technical requirements such as feature a looping sequence allowing the game to contact the server and get a result.</p>
		<p>So I came up with a game which featured the squirrel from the packs trying to get to her breakfast. The user clicks the ‘jump’ button and she gears up to jump, testing the branch she’s on (this is the looping section), then one of four possible outcomes is played: 3 different slapstick lose animations and a triumphant win animation.</p>
		<p>The game’s done pretty well despite the obvious dropoff when switching over. This was my first instant win game design and remains my favourite. It’s funny, there’s a clear story, and I’m really proud of the animations. The more recent games I’ve designed have focused more on their ability to get people coming back and playing every day (which is, I suppose, the point of them) and so they tend to mimic casino games in their tension and misrepresentation of the incredibly low odds, at the expense of humour and story. </p>

		<h3>Stop Motion – Yeo Valley</h3>
		<p>I’ve done quite a lot of animations, both digital and stop motion, for Yeo Valley but this one’s my favourite. The idea is that kids can cut the animals out of the packs and assemble them into these little models, so we shot a couple of films to show them off. This one was just a simple‘Merry Christmas’ message but it came out really well and the client was really happy with it.</p>

		<h3>Delve</h3>
		<p>Delve is a personal project I’ve been working on for almost a year now. It’s a relatively complicated and extremely nerdy card game that plays like a sped up and trimmed down D&D. I’ve designed it purely for myself and my friends but the testing has gone really well so I’m going to look at getting it published.</p>
