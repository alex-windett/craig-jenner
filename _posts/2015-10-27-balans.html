		<h3>Brief</h3>
		<p>Balans is a long-running chain of restaurants across London that used to be quite edgy and very popular in the gay scene but after a change in management started to become increasingly mainstream and lose their edge. We were tasked with reinvigorating the brand, injecting it with an adult, risqué, and bohemian personality. This was right up my street.</p>
		<p>Despite obviously needing to really show off the new character of the brand, the website had to cater to the typical user journeys of a restaurant site: locating restaurants, checking menus, reserving tables, and looking for contact information.</p>
		<p>The biggest complication with this was that the five different restaurants run different menus, have different opening hours, and run different special offers.</p>

		<p>All of the restaurants having different menus and opening times meant that almost all of the user journeys rely on the user choosing a restaurant location first.</p>
		<p>The landing page for the website lets you either choose a location or go through the member’s area and nothing else. Better to force them to make a choice than make an assumption and give them potentially inaccurate information.</p>
		<p>After choosing a location the user is taken through to a long page with opening information, contact details, gallery, menu, reservation widget, and job opportunities.</p>

	<h3>Design</h3>

	<p>The plan for the design was to be dark, suggestive, playful, and risqué. I also needed to incorporate a secret society, freemasons aesthetic into the designs which I managed by using woodcut illustrations in the main photography, and filling the site with innuendo, references to Greek mythology, and nods to The Wizard of Oz (mainly for my own amusement, let’s be honest).</p>

	<p>I’m particularly proud of the illustrations I created for the header images across the site, not just for the various references I managed to cram into them. They really help to get across the brand character, making the restaurant seem decadent, suggestive, and definitely bizarre. Whether it’s Jesus casually trying to pick up girls at the bar or an Indian sepoy standing guard outside in his heels and stockings, nothing is more Balans.</p>
